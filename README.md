# Social Media Challenge Research (Deidentified)

Here is a collection of notebooks suitable for public view from some work I've done in collaboration with Dr. Annie Margaret at CU Boulder. We investigate the outcome of a self-directed social media challenge across 6 semesters of students. Please email me if you have any questions. Note that this project contributed to the launch of the Post-Internet Project non-profit organization and is currently in development to become a major part of PRISM.
