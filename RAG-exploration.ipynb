       "\"How will you enforce these new time limits? If we want to succeed we need to have a replacement behavior and/or a strong reward system set up! How much are you on Instagram, reddit, and YikYak currently? What do you want to do with the new time you'll have? Knowing what you DO want to be doing, rather than only what you DON'T want to be doing will set you up for success! Great job including your intentions! It sounds like your main intent is to improve your mood by not viewing as much negative / hateful content. I recommend checking out some loving kindness meditations online! Brain changes can happen with as little as 5 mins a day!\\nThis is a lot of change all at once. How much are you currently using instagram and snapchat? How will you enforce this new behaviors? When the time limit comes up, what will you do instead to ensure you don't just click ignore? If you want to completely stop using snapchat will you delete the app off your phone? Some people like to let their friends know when they are going to delete a social app so their friends don't think they're just not responding. The more we speak to others about how social technologies are impacting our mental health, the more the awareness grows, and the culture shifts! Will you change your bedtime routine or move your phone away from your bed to make sure you don't open twitter or watch youtube? When we set goals it's important to change our environment or routine to make sticking to the goal as easy as possible! You got this!! I hope you make some of the changes and see the benefits showing up in your life!\\nThis is an admirable goal, but how will you enforce this? How will you praise yourself if you achieve this goal? How much are you currently on your phone? Is cutting back to just one hour a huge change for you? If so, maybe think about starting with a smaller change and cutting back gradually. Or just spending the first week noticing which specific social media behaviors impact your self-worth more than others?\""

    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base\n",
    "The base response thoroughly addresses the input, but it is simple feedback without much elaboration. However, I was impressed that it provided any feedback whatsoever given that I just gave it my goals without any context.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prompt\n",
    "When we provide ChatGPT with extra context about being a supportive life coach who gives feedback on goals its performance noticably improved. It correctly identifies that the final goal of \"being more intentional\" is not very specific and offers suggestions to make the goal more achievable. It even mentions the importance of aligning social media use with values. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### RAG\n",
    "The RAG approach far exceeds the base and prompt approaches. The response enumerates each goal and provides feedback in turn. It suggests replacing time spent on reddit with a different, more fulfilling activity. It suggests having a plan in place for what to do once a time limit is reached on your phone so you can actively engage with something else. Finally, it commends the user for desiring more intentional time spent on social media, but proceeds to clarify what that process might look like (similar to the prompt response). The final lines of the response really sound like Annie, referring to the PRISM process as a 'journey', reminding the user to be kind to themselves, to celebrate their victories, before signing off with a final line of encouragement: 'Keep up the great work!'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final thoughts:\n",
    "I think this proves the effectiveness of the RAG approach. The feedback generated by ChatGPT was more specific, more elaborated, and more similar in tone to Annie than the base or prompt-only approaches. We should continue testing with more diverse goals and edge cases, but, in my opinion, we should proceed with the development of a fully usable, user-friendly application."
